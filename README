Treecle 1.1.4
-------------
Treecle creates and manages user-defined, custom-built trees.

Whatever that means, it does sounds impressive.

Seriously, Treecle can be used to create a heirarchy of your own design,
representing whatever structure exists in the data you want to store. This
heirarchy can be stored, retrieved, expanded, etc., in any way within the
limits of the program through the treelike user interface.

Changes in version 1.1.4
------------------------
1. If no file name is set the program asks the user to supply one.

Changes in version 1.1.3
------------------------
1. Added a File-Save-As item to the main menu.

Changes in version 1.1.2
------------------------
1. On exit, the program would ask to save the data to file even when it was not
modified. Fixed.
2. There were problems in displaying non-English characters. Fixed, hopefully.
3. Added a shortcut key sequence to quit the program.

Changes in version 1.1.1
------------------------
This version fixes some minor bugs, for which many thanks to Tim Scheit, who
has also provided the German translation for all the user-visible text. This is
incorporated in a translation file, which is used by the interface if the
language locale is German.
The toolbar layout is also modified.

Changes in version 1.1
----------------------
1. Added the facility the sort the tree in ascending or descending order
2. Added a box to the toolbar to search for and find text in the tree.
3. Modified the README and PDF help file.

Availability
------------
Treecle is available as source code to compile on your own machine, or as a
package containing binaries to install and use.

Compiling the source
--------------------
ALl the source files are available on Github under the following link:
https://github.com/letapk/treecle

The repository is public. Anyone can check out the branch onto her local machine.

You will need the libraries and developement files from Qt, which are
available from the depository of your Linux distribution or from www.qt.io.

You will also need the QtWebKit and QtWebKitWidgets package as well, since
new versions of Qt do not include them anymore.
These should contain and provide the developement files and libraries compatible with the
version of Qt on your system.

The current source tree compiles and runs using Qt version 5.15.2 under Kubuntu 22.04.

If you are using QtCreator, load the project file treecle.pro which is available in the source
package. Select the version you want to build (debug version or release version) and hit
Ctrl-B. If there are no problems, this should build the binary.

The binary may be stored locally in a directoriy separate from the source subdirectory,
depending on how QtCreator is configured. This location will be available within QtCreator.

If you are not using QtCreator, running the comand:
>qmake treecle.pro
in a terminal should create a Makefile for your system. Then, running:
>make
should create a running binary.

If you are using QtCreator, the location of the locally compiled binary will be
available from within QtCreator. From this location copy the binary to a place from where
everyone working on the computer can run it.

In a terminal window give the command:
sudo cp ./treecle /usr/local/bin/treecle
Enter the password when prompted.

This copies the binary to /usr/local/bin. if you need the German language translation, then do:
sudo cp ./treecle_de.qm /usr/local/bin/treecle_de.qm

When executing the program for the first time in any account, a message notifying the creation of
a hidden subdirectory named ".treecle" will appear. In order to view the online help, the presence
of the help file (treeclehelp.pdf) in this location is required.

The file COPYING, which displays information about the program and the license is also required to be
here to enable viewing it from within the utility.
